**Last Updated:** 2026-01-28

## Login Problems
### “Incorrect password” errors
- Confirm customer is using the correct username
- Suggest password reset
- If locked out after failed attempts: lockout typically clears after 30 minutes

### MFA / One-time code issues
- Verify phone number on file
- Suggest checking spam/blocked SMS settings
- If SIM swap suspected: escalate to security

## Payments Failing
- Check if customer has sufficient balance/limit
- Confirm beneficiary details
- Ask customer to try again after 10 minutes (temporary gateway issues)

## App Crashes / Freezes
- Recommend update to latest version
- Clear app cache (Android) or reinstall (iOS)
- If outage: reference outage bulletin and open ticket

## Rep Guidance
- Collect device OS, app version, and exact error message for escalation.
