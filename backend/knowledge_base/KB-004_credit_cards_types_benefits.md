## Unauthorized Charges / Card Fraud
### What counts as unauthorized?
- Transactions the customer confirms they did not make
- Card-present or online transactions without customer authorization

### Dispute Process
1. Freeze card immediately if fraud suspected
2. Verify recent transactions with customer
3. Open dispute case and collect details:
   - Merchant name
   - Amount and date
   - Customer statement (what happened)
4. Provisional credit:
   - May be issued within 1–3 business days for eligible cases
5. Investigation timeline:
   - Typically 10–45 days depending on card scheme/merchant response
6. Final outcome:
   - If confirmed fraud: permanent credit and replacement card
   - If not fraud: provisional credit reversed

### Customer Communication
- Provide case ID and expected time range.
- Encourage password changes if online compromise suspected.

## Rep Guidance
- Never promise immediate refund; use “provisional credit may be available”.
- Advise customer to file a police report only if required by local policy or high-value fraud.
